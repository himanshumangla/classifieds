# Classifieds-Web-App
This is a working prototype of Campus specific classifieds web app, developed for I-MADE app-a-thon, held in association with Dept. Of Telecommunication, Govt. Of India, at IGDTUW, Kashmere Gate.
The UI has been made using a BootStrap template and HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
For the backend part, we used XAMPP server and wrote php scripts to handle SQL queries.
This prototype can be used to venture into the so far uncaptured classifieds sector, specifically in higher educatioon schools, within and outside of India.
